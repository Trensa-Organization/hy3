i3 / sway like layout for [hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprland).

[Installation](#installation), [Configuration](#configuration)

*Check the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for a list of new features and improvements*

### Features

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The master branch of hy3 follows the master branch of hyprland.
> Attempting to use a mismatched hyprland release will result in failure when building or loading hy3.
>
> To use hy3 against a release version of hyprland,
> check out the matching hy3 tag for the hyprland version.
> hy3 tags are formatted as `hl{version}` where `{version}` matches the release version of hyprland.

### hyprpm
Hyprland now has a dedicated plugin manager, which should be used when your package manager
isn't capable of locking hy3 builds to the correct hyprland version.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure hyprpm is activated by putting
>
> ```conf
> exec-once = hyprpm reload -n
> ```
>
> in your hyprland.conf. (See [the wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Plugins/Using-Plugins/) for details.)

To install hy3 via hyprpm run

```sh
hyprpm add https://github.com/outfoxxed/hy3
```

To update hy3 (and all other plugins), run

```sh
hyprpm update
```

(See [the wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Plugins/Using-Plugins/) for details.)

> [!WARNING]
> When you are running a tagged hyprland version hyprpm (0.34.0+) will build against hy3's
> corrosponding release. However if you are running an untagged build (aka `-git`) hyprpm
> will build against hy3's *latest* commit. This means **if you are running an out of date
> untagged build of hyprland, hyprpm may pick an incompatible revision of hy3**.
>
> To fix this problem you will either need to update hyprland or manually build the correct
> version of hy3.

### Nix
#### Hyprland home manager module
Assuming you use hyprland's home manager module, you can easily integrate hy3 by adding it to the plugins array.

```nix
# flake.nix

{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

    home-manager = {
      url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };

    hyprland.url = "github:hyprwm/Hyprland?ref=v{version}"; # where {version} is the hyprland release version
    # or "github:hyprwm/Hyprland" to follow the development branch

    hy3 = {
      url = "github:outfoxxed/hy3?ref=hl{version}"; # where {version} is the hyprland release version
      # or "github:outfoxxed/hy3" to follow the development branch.
      # (you may encounter issues if you dont do the same for hyprland)
      inputs.hyprland.follows = "hyprland";
    };
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs, home-manager, hyprland, hy3, ... }: {
    homeConfigurations."user@hostname" = home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
      pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux;

      modules = [
        hyprland.homeManagerModules.default

        {
          wayland.windowManager.hyprland = {
            enable = true;
            plugins = [ hy3.packages.x86_64-linux.hy3 ];
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

#### Manual (Nix)
hy3's binary is availible as `${hy3.packages.<system>.hy3}/lib/libhy3.so`, so you can also
directly use it in your hyprland config like so:

```nix
# ...
wayland.windowManager.hyprland = {
  # ...
  extraConfig = ''
    plugin = ${hy3.packages.x86_64-linux.hy3}/lib/libhy3.so
  '';
};
```


### Manual
Install hyprland, including its headers and pkg-config file, then run the following commands:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build
cmake --build build
```

The plugin will be located at `build/libhy3.so`, and you can load it normally
(See [the hyprland wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Plugins/Using-Plugins/#installing--using-plugins) for details.)

Note that the hyprland headers and pkg-config file **MUST be installed correctly, for the target version of hyprland**.

## Configuration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The configuration listed below is for the current hy3 commit.
> If you are using a release version of hy3 then make sure you are
> reading the tagged revision of this readme.

Set your `general:layout` to `hy3` in hyprland.conf.

hy3 requires using a few custom dispatchers for normal operation.
In your hyprland config replace the following dispatchers:
 - `movefocus` -> `hy3:movefocus`
 - `movewindow` -> `hy3:movewindow`

You can use `hy3:makegroup` to create a new split.

The [dispatcher list](#dispatcher-list) and [config fields](#config-fields) sections have all the
configuration options, and some explanation as to what they do.
[The hyprland config in my dots](https://git.outfoxxed.me/outfoxxed/nixnew/src/branch/master/modules/hyprland/hyprland.conf) can also be used as a reference.

### Config fields

### Dispatcher list
 - `hy3:makegroup, <h | v | opposite | tab>, [ephemeral | force_ephemeral]` - make a vertical / horizontal split or tab group
   - `ephemeral` - the group will be removed once it contains only one node. does not affect existing groups.
   - `force_ephemeral` - same as ephemeral, but converts existing single windows groups.
 - `hy3:changegroup, <h | v | tab | untab | toggletab | opposite>` - change the group the node belongs to, to a different layout
   - `untab` will untab the group if it was previously tabbed
   - `toggletab` will untab if group is tabbed, and tab if group is untabbed
   - `opposite` will toggle between horizontal and vertical layouts if the group is not tabbed.
 - `hy3:setephemeral, <true | false>` - change the ephemerality of the group the node belongs to
 - `hy3:movefocus, <l | u | d | r | left | down | up | right>, [visible]` - move the focus left, up, down, or right
   - `visible` - only move between visible nodes, not hidden tabs
 - `hy3:movewindow, <l | u | d | r | left | down | up | right>, [once], [visible]` - move a window left, up, down, or right
   - `once` - only move directly to the neighboring group, without moving into any of its subgroups
   - `visible` - only move between visible nodes, not hidden tabs
 - `hy3:movetoworkspace, <workspace>, [follow]` - move the active node to the given workspace
   - `follow` - change focus to the given workspace when moving the selected node
 - `hy3:killactive` - close all windows in the focused node
 - `hy3:changefocus, <top | bottom | raise | lower | tab | tabnode>`
   - `top` - focus all nodes in the workspace
   - `bottom` - focus the single root selection window
   - `raise` - raise focus one level
   - `lower` - lower focus one level
   - `tab` - raise focus to the nearest tab
   - `tabnode` - raise focus to the nearest node under the tab
 - `hy3:focustab <mouse | [l | r | left | right | index, <index>], [prioritize_hovered | require_hovered], [wrap]>`
   - `mouse` - focus the tab under the mouse, works well with a non consuming bind, e.g.
     ```conf
     # binds hy3:focustab to lmb and still allows windows to receive clicks
     bindn = , mouse:272, hy3:focustab, mouse
     ```
   - `l | r | left | right` - direction to change focus towards
   - `index, <index>` - select the `index`th tab
   - `prioritize_hovered` - prioritize the tab group under the mouse when multiple are stacked. use the lowest group if none is under the mouse.
   - `require_hovered` - affect the tab group under the mouse. do nothing if none are hovered.
   - `wrap` - wrap to the opposite size of the tab bar if moving off the end
 - `hy3:debugnodes` - print the node tree into the hyprland log
 - `hy3:resizenode, <vector>` - like Hyprland `resizeactive`, but applied to the whole focused group instead of just a window
 - :warning: **ALPHA QUALITY** `hy3:setswallow, <true | false | toggle>` - set the containing node's window swallow state
 - :warning: **ALPHA QUALITY** `hy3:expand, <expand | shrink | base>` - expand the current node to cover other nodes
   - `expand` - expand by one node
   - `shrink` - shrink by one node
   - `base` - undo all expansions
